# Objectives

To support cities and communities to use consistent and machine-undertstandable definitions of all the entities about which data is being captured in a data ecosystem. This includes syntactic and semantic definitions. This MIM supports data users to use data models, serialisations and formats that support specific use cases, in a minimal way.
