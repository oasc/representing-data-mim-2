# Accessing Data Minimum Interoperability Mechanisms 

This repository contains the development version of the Open & Agile Smart Cities' development version of the Representing Data Minimum Interoperability Mechanisms.

[Open & Agile Smart Cities](https://oascities.org/) is a global network that assists local administrations of all sizes in their digital transformation.

[Minimal Interoperability Mechanism](https://oascities.org/minimal-interoperability-mechanisms/) are vendor-neutral and technology-agnostic mechanisms to help enable a minimal but sufficient level of interoperability for data, systems, and services.

This Minimal Interoperability Mechanism is about Representing Data.
It helps facilitate the ways data can be accessed, once data sets are discovered and agreements are in place.

Each Minimal Interoperability Mechanism is composed of:
- Objective
- Capabilities and Requirements
- Mechanisms
- Interoperability Guidance
- Conformance and Compliance Testing
